<h3>Challenges</h3>
The logic for this project was tricky. Phrasing the if then statements to ensure the right person won was challenging. Sometimes I'd get errors because I'd forget a curly brace or paranthesis.
<br>
<h3>Coolest Feature</h3>
I'm proud of the personality I gave the messages. And for not following the instructions exactly.
<br>
<h3>Future Improvement</h3>
Add HTML/CSS for browser support and true user input. It's not much of a game if you can't play yourself.
