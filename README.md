## Challenges

The logic for this project was tricky. Phrasing the if then statements to ensure the right person won was challenging. Sometimes I'd get errors because I'd forget a curly brace or paranthesis.

## Takeaways

Adding HTML/CSS for browser support and true user input would make this more fun. It's not much of a game if you can't play yourself.
